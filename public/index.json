In this paper, we describe a collaborative academic–industry–government approach to obtaining direct presence–absence data for SBAs and to measuring gear interactions with seafloor habitats via a novel deepwater trap camera and motion-sensing systems on commercial longline traps for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) within SGaan Kinghlas – Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area. We obtained direct presence–absence observations of cold-water corals (Alcyonacea, Antipatharia, Pennatulacea, Stylasteridae) and sponges (Hexactinellida, Demospongiae) at 92 locations over three commercial fishing trips. Video, accelerometer, and depth sensor data were used to estimate a mean bottom footprint of 53 m2 for a standard sablefish trap, which translates to 3200 m2 (95% CI = 2400–3900 m2) for a 60-trap commercial sablefish longline set. Our successful collaboration demonstrates how research partnerships with commercial fisheries have potential for massive improvements in the quantity and quality of data needed for conducting SBA risk assessments over large spatial and temporal scales","tags":[],"title":"Using autonomous video to estimate the bottom-contact area of longline trap gear and presence–absence of sensitive benthic habitat","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This is version 3 of my personal website. I’ve revised to a Hugo powered blogdown generated website for two reasons. First, it’s a static site generator, similar to Jekyll, serving to keep things simple and fast on the server side. Second, I’ve wanted to start blogging more, and I think the Rmarkdown integration with blogdown and Hugo will help smooth this out.\nThis post is a test post for using Rmarkdown to build a simple population dynamics model with process error, and generate some data with observation error. Pushing this post to github pages will require working out how TravisCI works, which I learned from David Selby’s Tea and Stats blog, which is a handy resource.\nSo, let’s get started by defining a function for the population dynamics model. I’m going to use a Schaefer surplus production model (Schaefer 1957). I like to define my Schafer models using optimal equilibrium values, known as \\(B_{MSY}\\) and \\(U_{MSY}\\) in the fisheries literature, as the leading parameters.\nset.seed(123) # Create a function to quickly call for generating biomass prodMod \u0026lt;- function( Umsy = 0.06, Bmsy = 42, procSigma = 0.1, obsSigma = 0.2, nT = 100 ) { # Vectors to hold biomass and catch Bt \u0026lt;- numeric( length = nT ) Ct \u0026lt;- numeric( length = nT ) # Create a sequence of harvest rates Utmult \u0026lt;- c(seq(0.1,2,length = 20),seq(2,1, length = 20), rep(1,nT - 40) ) Ut \u0026lt;- Utmult * Umsy # And draw process errors epst \u0026lt;- rnorm(nT-1, sd = procSigma) # Initialise at unfished Bt[1] \u0026lt;- 2 * Bmsy # Take first year\u0026#39;s catch Ct[1] \u0026lt;- Ut[1] * Bt[1] # Now loop and fill remaining years for( t in 2:nT ) { # Generate non-stochastic biomass Bt[t] \u0026lt;- Bt[t-1] + 2 * Umsy * Bt[t-1] * (1 - Bt[t-1] / Bmsy / 2) - Ct[t-1] # Add process errors Bt[t] \u0026lt;- Bt[t] * exp( epst[t-1]) # Take catch Ct[t] \u0026lt;- Bt[t] * Ut[t] } # Draw observation errors deltat \u0026lt;- rnorm(nT, sd = obsSigma) # Generate absolute index of biomass It \u0026lt;- Bt * exp(deltat) # Return biomass, catch and model time dimension outList \u0026lt;- list( Bt = Bt, It = It, Ct = Ct, nT = nT ) } # Generate the biomass popSP \u0026lt;- prodMod() # Plot the biomass and catch plot( x = 1:popSP$nT, y = popSP$Bt, xlab = \u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Biomass and Catch\u0026quot;, ylim = c(0,max(popSP$Bt)), type = \u0026quot;l\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, las = 1 ) rect( xleft = 1:popSP$nT-.3, xright = 1:popSP$nT + .3, ybottom = 0, ytop = popSP$Ct, col = \u0026quot;grey40\u0026quot;, border = NA ) points( x = 1:popSP$nT, y = popSP$It, pch = 21, col = \u0026quot;grey60\u0026quot;, cex = .8 ) Our figure shows a 2-way trip, which describes how the biomass declines at first (the first way), then comes back up as catch is decreased (the second way). This is an ideal data set for fisheries stock assessment, as there is contrast in the catch and biomass, making it informative about both the scale of the biomass, helping to estimate \\(B_{MSY}\\), and the productivity of the stock, helping to estimate \\(U_{MSY}\\).\nThe next part of this post will fit a TMB model to the data generated from the above biomass. I ran this same tutorial in a seminar for our lab group at SFU this past fall, so I’ll be copying and pasting the code in from there.\nSchaefer, Milner B. 1957. “Some Considerations of Population Dynamics and Economics in Relation to the Management of the Commercial Marine Fisheries.” Journal of the Fisheries Board of Canada 14 (5).

In this paper, we simulate data-rich and data-poor fishery and survey data scenarios for a complex of dover sole stocks. Simulated data for individual stocks were used to compare estimation performance for single-stock and hierarchical multi-stock versions of a Schaefer production model. The single-stock and best performing multi-stock models were then used in stock assessments for the real dover sole data. Multi-stock models often had lower estimation errors than single-stock models when assessment data had low statistical power. Relative errors for productivity and relative biomass parameters were lower for multi-stock assessment model configurations. In addition, multi-stock models that estimated hierarchical priors for survey catchability performed the best under data-poor scenarios. We conclude that hierarchical multi-stock assessment models are useful for data-limited stocks and could provide a more flexible alternative to data-pooling and catch only methods; however, these models are subject to non-linear side-effects of parameter shrinkage. Therefore, we recommend testing hierarchical multi-stock models in closed-loop simulations before application to real fishery management systems.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the role of data quality when sharing information in hierarchical multi-stock assessment models, with an application to Dover Sole.","type":"publication"}]
