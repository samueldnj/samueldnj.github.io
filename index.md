I'm a PhD student working in the [Quantitative Fisheries Research Group](http://www.quantitativefisheries.com), part of the School of [Resource and Environmental Management](http://rem.sfu.ca) at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca). My senior supervisor is [Dr. Sean Cox](http://www.rem.sfu.ca/people/faculty/seancox/).

My research is focused on improving ecological sustainability and profitability in multispecies groundfish fisheries. Multispecies interactions between high value target species and low value non-target species constrain profitability in fisheries, due to restrictive catch limits and non-selective fishing gear. I'm interested in how to use novel statistical methods and fishery monitoring data to improve assessment and avoidance techniques, leading to a more sustainable and profitable resource.

I received my Master's degree from Simon Fraser University. I worked with Dr. [Marni Mishna](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~mmishna/) in the [Department of Mathematics](http://math.sfu.ca), counting restricted lattice walks in 2 dimensions.

I'm also an ecological consultant, currently working with [Landmark Fisheries Research](http://landmarkfisheries.com). I specialise in quantitative modeling of fisheries systems.
